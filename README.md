# cf-tech-challenge
## Introduction
Hello! If you're reading this, you're probably from the company that asked me to do this tech challenge. I'll do my best to be as comprehensive as possible without disclosing the entirety of the challenge rules, though reading through the code might have an effect on that.

## Getting Started
Note: This code is tested and run on terraform version 1.1.9

After cloning the repo and entering the project's root directory, run the following:
```
terraform init
terraform apply
```
You will be prompted to fill in some variables and then the code will run. If you would like to use a tfvars file, feel free to create the file "tfvars/private.tfvars". I will be including a "tfvars/template.tfvars" file to use as a starting point.
