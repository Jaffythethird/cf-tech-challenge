# CF Tech Challenge
## Introduction
Hello! If you're reading this, you're probably from the company that asked me to do this tech challenge. The documentation for this project will be sent to my recruiter in PDF format.

## Getting Started
Note: This code is tested and run on terraform version 1.1.9

After cloning the repo and entering the project's root directory, run the following:
```
terraform init
terraform apply
```
You will be prompted to fill in some variables and then the code will run. If you would like to use a tfvars file, feel free to create the file "tfvars/private.tfvars". I will be including a "tfvars/template.tfvars" file to use as a starting point.
